# reading-notes
keep track of your observations and questions from the reading assignments throughout 201
**completed a private repository for reading 02**
Hope to understand more practical uses of these tools in upcoming lessons.


***Reading 03 Role of Help Desk***
- shows again the need of soft skills/social skills. The 'face' of the company is the help desk agent, so these skills have an outsized role.
- The reading describes in detail what can be expected in a help desk role despite the various environments. It provides a good idea of what can be expected for many entry level jobs.
- Again, the article stressed throughout the need for social and writing skills in candidates.


***Reading 04 Troubleshooting***
- This assignment gave a clear flowchart to follow for troubleshooting IT issues (or any issues)
- A recommendation to document each solved problem into a database was recommended. *Ask for recommended programs*
*Ensure retention of Change Control Window (agreed time to fix IT issue in coordination with the requestor/client )








***Reading 08***
-This covered the registry in windows. I admit to having no prior knowledge of it, but now understand it better as where settings for each program/application can be saved. All windows services use this registry, and other software may or may not use it (or use it partially for some files).




***Reading 12*** 
-PFSense is the tool this reading and the upcoming lab will focus on. It is software designed to establish and maintain router functions. Old computers can be given a new use in this manner.
