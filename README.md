keep track of your observations and questions from the reading assignments throughout 201


***Reading 01*** 
Submitted via discussion thread

***Reading 02 completed a private repository***
Hope to understand more practical uses of these tools in upcoming lessons.


***Reading 03 Role of Help Desk***
- shows again the need of soft skills/social skills. The 'face' of the company is the help desk agent, so these skills have an outsized role.
- The reading describes in detail what can be expected in a help desk role despite the various environments. It provides a good idea of what can be expected for many entry level jobs.
- Again, the article stressed throughout the need for social and writing skills in candidates.


***Reading 04 Troubleshooting***
- This assignment gave a clear flowchart to follow for troubleshooting IT issues (or any issues)
- A recommendation to document each solved problem into a database was recommended. *Ask for recommended programs*
*Ensure retention of Change Control Window (agreed time to fix IT issue in coordination with the requestor/client )


***Reading 05***
-Learning about SMB protocol led me to learning and understanding more about open ports and the misconceptions behind them, but also about UDP v TCP and how they differ.

***Reading 06***
-This was about windows defender and how to use the various tools/settings within it. It is straightforward and user friendly. Microsoft offers this service for other OS's as well under the name Microsoft Defender.


***Reading 07***
-Powershell is clearly defined in this reading and a great comparison is made to bash. Bash is creating, powershell is doing.
The article concretely listed the benefits of learning Powershell as well, and made it clear that not learning it comes at the cost of not remaining competitive in the career field.


***Reading 08***
-This covered the registry in windows. I admit to having no prior knowledge of it, but now understand it better as where settings for each program/application can be saved. All windows services use this registry, and other software may or may not use it (or use it partially for some files).

***Reading 09***
-This reading covered SOP's. While I have never created an SOP, I am familiar with the structuring and utilization of them.


***Reading 10***
-This is an Intro to the VEEM software, a tool that we can use for migrating , updating, and more for VM's.


***Reading 11***
-This is great insight on how to assess signs from a SSD for potential failure. I have not yet expirienced an SSD failure, but the ways to detect one are different than what I have seen in the past with HDD failures.
The article also suggests looking for S.M.A.R.T options when buying a new SSD so that there is some form of built in monitoring.
As always, frequent backups of important data are still key.

***Reading 12*** 
-PFSense is the tool this reading and the upcoming lab will focus on. It is software designed to establish and maintain router functions. Old computers can be given a new use in this manner.

***Reading 13***
-This gives several nice visuals to help comprehend exactly what the AWS EC2 and other cloud computing entails. Essentially, cloud virtualization comes from a host's hardware (in this article it would be Amazon) running virtualization software and making these VM's available to customers via a web interface. 
***Reading 14***
-Malware and virus detection in windows usually occurs via windows defender or another program meant to detect these threats. However, when something is missed, this article points us to the correct method to remove it. This involves booting into safe mode to prevent unecessary programs from running, cleaning the disk (removing temp filies) and then running an on demand scan with a different program than those that missed the threat initially.
